<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Santhosh Thadakala, a graduate in AI/ML with a strong interest in web development. I've worked on several basic projects in web development, which has helped me gain hands-on experience and improve my skills in creating functional and appealing web pages. Now, I'm looking to take things further by pursuing a master’s degree to deepen my understanding of AI/ML and expand my technical abilities, especially in web development.

  My day-to-day routine keeps me focused and productive: </p>
  I start my day at 6:30 AM and manage a busy college schedule from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. I make time for an hour at the gym every day to stay fit and maintain a good balance between my studies and personal goals.</p> Right now, I’m preparing for the IELTS exam, working on improving my Java skills, and honing my web development expertise to get ready for the next step in my academic and professional journey. I'm excited to build on what I've learned and take my skills to the next level with a master’s program.</p>
